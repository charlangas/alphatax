                        <p>At a 2% effective tax rate, your $10M property is costing you the equivalent of two full months of rent—just in property taxes. Add insurance, and you're looking at three to four months' rent going straight to expenses you thought you couldn't control.</p>

                        <p>You focused intensely on comps, P&Ls, and rent rolls during acquisition. You negotiated the purchase price. Then you assumed the property tax bill was fixed—and plugged that $200,000 into your long-term forecast.</p>

                        <p> Every year, hundreds of investors receive their valuation notice in the spring and scramble to take action. By the time the tax bill arrives in the fall, the protest window has been closed for months. It's too late.</p>

                    <p>This is 100% false.</p>
                    <p>The county's appraisal value is only for tax purposes. Your property's sales price (resale value) is determined by a completely separate fee appraiser, who is hired by the bank during the sales transaction.</p>
                    <p>There is zero negative consequence to lowering your tax appraisal.</p>
                    <p>The county's tax value and your property's sales price are determined by completely different appraisers using different methods. They have zero connection. You can sell your property for twice its lowered appraisal value if the market supports it. The bank's appraiser doesn't care what the county says your property is worth for tax purposes.</p>

                        <h3>The Insider's Strategy: Why the Equal & Uniform (E&U) appeal is the key to a strong appeal—not Market Value.</h3>
                        <p>80% of our reductions come from E&U appeals. This strategy can be used to seek reductions even when your property's market value is correct. Just because your property is worth its appraised value doesn't mean it should be taxed at that level.</p>

                        <p>Large metro firms send affidavits and negotiate via email. We show up in person with a rolling briefcase full of 80-100 property workups. Personal relationships with district staff and insider knowledge give us an edge that out-of-town firms can't match.</p>

                    <h2>About Brent Harrison</h2>
                    <p>Brent spent 16 years inside the Lubbock Appraisal District as the Appraisal Coordinator, overseeing all appraisers. He knows the system inside and out—because he helped build it.</p>
                    <p>Now, he's on your side.</p>
                    <p>Brent has fought for property owners across 80 Texas counties, representing high-value commercial and multifamily properties worth $5M to $100M+. His team has a strong track record of building comprehensive, data-driven appeals for clients—using the insider strategies most investors never learn.</p>
                    <p>Unlike firms that send affidavits, Brent shows up in person for face-to-face negotiations. He has first-name-basis relationships with appraisal district staff across West Texas. He's settled four lawsuits in 30 minutes with a chief appraiser at a continuing education seminar—because they have each other's cell phone numbers.</p>
                    <p>That's what in-person advocacy looks like.</p>
